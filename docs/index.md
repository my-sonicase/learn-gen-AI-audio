# 🔊 How to Learn AI for Audio & Sound

<p class="hero-subtitle">
Ciao! This is My Sonicase blog on how I learn AI for sound and audio. I believe the best way to actually learn AI is to build things. Follow a great course, and in the meantime go implement stuff. Read a paper, then try to reproduce it. Break things. That's how it sticks. So this is my open lab where I do exactly that. The twist is that <strong>everything I build, I apply to sound, music, and audio</strong>. Even when a course teaches general deep learning, I always steer my projects toward generative soundscapes, procedural audio, and creative sonic experiments. If it makes a sound, I'm happier and learn better. Let's go!

Each tile links to a page where I document what I'm learning, the code I write, and the audio experiments I run. It's all a work in progress. That's the point.

  <h3>Karpathy · Neural Networks: Zero to Hero</h3>
  <p>Build GPT from scratch, character by character. The concepts (tokenization, embeddings, self attention, autoregressive generation) are exactly what powers MusicGen and AudioLM. Where I can, I swap text for audio tokens.</p>

    Click any tile to see my notes, code, and audio demos. Everything here is unfinished and evolving. That's how learning works.
