# 🔊 How I Learn AI for Audio & Sound

<p class="hero-subtitle">
I believe the best way to actually learn AI is to build things. Follow a great course, sure, but then go implement stuff. Read a paper, then try to reproduce it. Break things. That's how it sticks. So this is my open lab where I do exactly that. The twist is that <strong>everything I build, I apply to sound, music, and audio</strong> (not speech). Even when a course teaches general deep learning, I always steer my projects toward generative soundscapes, procedural audio, and creative sonic experiments. If it doesn't make a sound, I'm not interested.

Each tile links to a page where I document what I'm learning, the code I write, and the audio experiments I run. It's all a work in progress. That's the point.

    Click any tile to see my notes, code, and audio demos. Everything here is unfinished and evolving. That's how learning works.
