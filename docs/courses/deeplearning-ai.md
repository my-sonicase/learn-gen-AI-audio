# 📐 Andrew Ng · Deep Learning Specialization

<p class="hero-subtitle">
Andrew Ng's <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/">Deep Learning Specialization</a> on Coursera is probably the single most important course for understanding neural networks from the ground up. Everyone should do it. <strong>My twist:</strong> every assignment and side project I do here uses audio data. Mel spectrograms as images, raw waveforms as sequences, music and environmental sound as classification targets. Same math, different domain.
