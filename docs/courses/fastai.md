# 🚀 fast.ai · Practical Deep Learning for Coders

<p class="hero-subtitle">
<a href="https://course.fast.ai/">fast.ai</a> teaches deep learning top down. You build working models from day one, then progressively understand what's happening under the hood. Jeremy Howard's whole philosophy is "just get coding" and I love that. <strong>My twist:</strong> every exercise, every project, every experiment here is steered toward audio. Spectrograms, waveforms, sound classification, generative sound. If it makes noise, I'm in.
