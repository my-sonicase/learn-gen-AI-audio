# 🤗 Hugging Face Audio Course

<p class="hero-subtitle">
The <a href="https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course">Hugging Face Audio Course</a> is a hands on guide to working with audio using the Hugging Face ecosystem. Loading datasets, fine tuning models for classification, generation, and everything in between. This one is directly about audio so I don't need to "translate" the exercises. I just go deep.
