# 🌊 Generative Audio Experiments

<p class="hero-subtitle">
This is where I collect experiments that don't belong to a single course. Diffusion based audio, neural synthesizers, generative soundscapes, procedural audio techniques. Sometimes inspired by a paper, sometimes just an idea I want to try. If it sounds interesting (literally), it ends up here.
